How to Install and Configure the Nvidia Drivers and Optimus
===


## Step 1: Installing the Drivers and Optimus-Manager

The first step is to simply install the nvidia drivers with the following command:
```
$ sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-libgl
```
If you are not able to install `lib32-nvidia-utils` or `lib32-nvidia-libgl`, don't worry, just move continue with the guide.


Once that is done, we need to install the `optimus-manager` package from the AUR.
You can use any AUR helper to do so; however, my personal favorite is `yay`.
So, I install the package with the following:
```
$ yay -S optimus-manager
```


## Step 2: Configuring the Nvidia Driver

First copy the template file to your Xorg config directory:
```
$ sudo cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf
```

Then open the new file in your favorite text editor: 
```
$ sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf
```
And modify it, such that it looks like the following:
```
Section "OutputClass"
    Identifier "intel"
    MatchDriver "i915"
    Driver "modesetting"
EndSection

Section "OutputClass"
    Identifier "nvidia"
    MatchDriver "nvidia-drm"
    Driver "nvidia"
    Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration"
    Option "PrimaryGPU" "yes"
    ModulePath "/usr/lib/nvidia/xorg"
    ModulePath "/usr/lib/xorg/modules"
EndSection
```

Now, edit your personal `~/.xinitrc` file, that is, if you wish to launch your session with X:
```
$ vim ~/.xinitrc
```
Adding the following lines after the shebang at the top:
```
xrandr --setprovideroutputsource modesetting NVIDIA-0
xrandr --auto
```


## Step 3: Start and Enable Optimus-Manager Service

Now that we have Optimus installed and our Xorg config set up we need to start and enable the Optimus service.
You can do this by typing:
```
$ sudo systemctl enable optimus-manager.service
$ sudo systemctl start optimus-manager.service
```

Now that the services are running, we want to switch to our, now configured, Nvidia driver.

First, tell Optimus that you want to use your Nvidia card when you start your system:
```
$ sudo optimus-manager --set-startup nvidia
```
Then, reboot your system:
```
$ reboot
```

## Conclusion

Your system should now be using the Nvidia card exclusively; however, you can change this with the following commands:
```
$ sudo optimus-manager --set-startup intel
$ sudo optimus-manager --set-startup hybrid
```

You will likely notice a major increase in performance; however, you may notice some screen tearing.
If you are experiencing screen tearing, I'd recommend reading this section of the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA_Optimus#Tearing/Broken_VSync) on troubleshooting tearing/broken vsync.
