A Quick Window Manager Install Guide for Arch Linux
===================================================

Choosing what desktop or window manager to use can be difficult, as there are so many options; however, I find that I always make my way back to i3-gaps (a verion of the i3 window manager that supports gaps).
The amount of configuration available and the simplicity of it all is quite nice.
Desktop environment like KDE, Gnome, and Unity offer a great experience for those who don't want to deal with the setup of a window manager; however, they lack the sheer amount of customizability that a window manager provides. 
While it might not be the best window manager for beginners (or even the best window manager), I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in customizability and simplicity.

 
The steps for setting up most window managers are the same (some of the steps are even the same as those for desktop environments).
So, let's use i3 as example.


## Step 1: Install the Window Manager, Xorg, and Xinit

If you have installed Arch Linux, then this step may seem trivial; however, with window managers and desktops you will often run into a few otions and i3 is no exception.
Simply type the following command to install i3:
```
# pacman -S i3 xorg-server xorg-xinit
```

You will be given some choices of packages to install. 
Personally, I prefer i3-gaps, so I type `1 3 4 5` in and hit `enter`.


## Step 2: Copy and Edit .xinitrc

Now that you have i3, xorg, and xinit installed, you are gonna have to set up xinit.
To do this simply copy the xinitrc file from `/etc` into your user's home directory:
```
# cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc /home/<USER>/.xinitrc
```

Since this is a configuration file, you probably don't want it being displayed all the time, so you can include a dot at the front of the file name.


Now, you just have to tell X that when it starts it needs to execute i3.
This can be done by appending `exec i3` to the bottom of your user's `.xinitrc` file:
```
# echo "exec i3" >> /home/<USER>/.xinitrc
```


## Step 3: Start X Server

Whenever you sign in as this user, you can now type the command `startx` to start the X server.
When X server starts, it will execute i3 and you should see the basic window manager.
From here you can hit `Mod+Enter` to open up a terminal, then use the `i3-config-wizard` command to generate a basic i3 configuration.
Personally, I store mine in `.config/i3/config`, but you may want this file to be located at `.i3` in your home directory (for easy access).


## Conclusion

That is all there is.
Really, setting up a window manager is that easy, now all thats left is configuring it to your heart's desire. 
As mentioned before, i3 offers a lot of customizability, and as a result of this it may seem a bit *lacking* at first.

So, here is a list of some programs I would recommend using to spruce up your i3 setup a bit:
* [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) - A highly configurable status bar 
* [urxvt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode) - An incredibly fast and customizable terminal emulator
* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - An absolutely fantastic text editor that has a plugin for just about everything you can imagine
* [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) - A terminal based filemanager, perfect for those who don't want to install all of KDE or Gtk just to move some files around
* [zathura](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zathura) - A vim-like document viewer that supports many types of files including EPUBs, PDFs, and even Comic Books
* [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) - A program that can generate and apply color schemes all over your system


I hope this post was helpful and wish you the best with using i3 or whatever window manager you choose to use.
