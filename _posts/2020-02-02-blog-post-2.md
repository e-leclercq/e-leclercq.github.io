How to Install and Configure the Nvidia Drivers and Optimus
===


## Step 1: Installing the Drivers and Optimus-Manager

The first step is to simply install the nvidia drivers with the following command:
```
$ sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-libgl
```

Once that is done, we need to install the `optimus-manager` package from the AUR.
You can use any AUR helper to do so; however, my personal favorite is `pikaur`.
So, I install the package with the following:
```
$ pikaur -S optimus-manager
```


## Step 2: Configuring the Nvidia Driver

First copy the template file to your Xorg config directory:
```
$ sudo cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf
```

Then open the new file in your favorite text editor: 
```
$ sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf
```
And modify it, such that it looks like the following:
```
Section "OutputClass"
    Identifier "intel"
    MatchDriver "i915"
    Driver "modesetting"
EndSection

Section "OutputClass"
    Identifier "nvidia"
    MatchDriver "nvidia-drm"
    Driver "nvidia"
    Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration"
    Option "PrimaryGPU" "yes"
    ModulePath "/usr/lib/nvidia/xorg"
    ModulePath "/usr/lib/xorg/modules"
EndSection
```

Then, edit your personal ~/.xinitrc:
```
$ vim ~/.xinitrc
```
Adding the following lines after the shebang at the top:
```
xrandr --setprovideroutputsource modesetting NVIDIA-0
xrandr --auto
```

Now reboot your system with:
```
$ sudo reboot
```


## Step 3: Start and Enable Optimus-Manager Service

Now that we have Optimus installed and our Xorg config set up we need to start and enable the Optimus service.
You can do this by typing:
```
$ sudo systemctl enable optimus-manager.service
$ sudo systemctl start optimus-manager.service
```

Now that the services are running, we want to switch to our, now configured, Nvidia driver.

First, tell Optimus that you want to use your Nvidia card when you start your system:
```
$ sudo optimus-manager --set-startup nvidia
```
Then, run `optimus-manager` with the `--switch` flag to switch to the Nvidia card immediately:
```
$ sudo optimus-manager --switch nvidia
```


# Conclusion

Your system should now be using the Nvidia card exclusively, unless you change back to the Intel card with:
```
$ sudo optimus-manager --set-startup intel
$ sudo optimus-manager --switch intel
```

You will likely notice a major increase in performance; however, there is a possibility that screen tearing might occur.
If you are getting some light screen tearing, I'd recommend reading this section of the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA_Optimus#Tearing/Broken_VSync) on troubleshooting tearing/broken vsync.
